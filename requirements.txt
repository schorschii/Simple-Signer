# Debian package note: since python3-pyqt5 is a build-dependency and --use-system-packages is set,
# PyQt5 will not be installed in the venv. This is important because only the system-wide PyQt installation
# enables us to use the system theme and avoids unnessesary duplicate installation of the Qt libs on the system.
